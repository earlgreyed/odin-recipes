        <li>1 head garlic (top sliced off)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F.</li>
        <li>To a casserole dish, add theÂ onions, sun dried tomatoes, paprika, salt, pepper and dried parsley.</li>
        <li>Toss, and then place the whole garlic head in the middle. Drizzle the entire dish with olive oil or the leftover sun dried tomato oil, cover with foil, and then pop in the oven for 1 hour, tossing halfway through. The onions should be caramelized by the time it comes out of the oven.</li>
        <li>About 20 minutes before the casserole dish is done, prepare the pasta according to package directions, reserving up to a cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Remove the garlic from the casserole dish, and when safe to handle, squeeze out the cloves. Add the fresh parsley, basil, lemon juice and coconut milk, along with the cooked pasta and pasta water as needed. Stir and enjoy!</li>
