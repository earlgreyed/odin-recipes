    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The perfect soup to have when you're feeling under the weather.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>340g skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup jasmine rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 5cm piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 small sweet potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1,2cm-thick rounds</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring chicken, rice, garlic, ginger, and 5 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add a big pinch of salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until rice has swelled and chicken is firm, 10–12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes to pan and cook over medium-low heat, still uncovered and stirring occasionally, until soup is thickened and potatoes and rice are tender, 15–20 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a bowl and shred with 2 forks, then return to pot. Stir in lemon juice and soy sauce; taste soup and season with salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with cilantro and lots of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Do Ahead: Soup (without cilantro) can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Reheat over medium-low, adding water to thin as needed.</li>
    </ol>
